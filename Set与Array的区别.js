Sets look like arrays, but a few of differences, 3 important ones below, 
the methods you can apply to them will be explained next...
1 Sets cannot contain duplicate entries
2 You cannot access elements in a set using index
3 You cannot sort elements in a set
If you require any of these things or want to convert your set into an array this can easily 
be done by var array = s.members();
